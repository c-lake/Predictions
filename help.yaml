    In a Prediction, you can bet with dedicated game points on 2 options: 🔷 Blue or 🔶 Orange.
  
  fields:
  - title: Claim your points
    content: |-
      To start betting, claim 300 game points with `/claim`.
      If you lost everything, you can still `/claim` again once per day.
  - title: Check your balance
    content: Check the game points you have with `/bal`.
  - title: Start a prediction
    content: |-
      Create a new prediction with `/start <title> <🔷 option 1> <🔶 option 2> <time limit>`.
      Everyone can then just place bets by clicking the 🔷 and 🔶 buttons.
  - title: Announce results

  fields:
  - title: Place a larger bet
    content: Find the buttons too slow when you are chipping in 1,000 points? Use `/bet <option 🔷 or 🔶> <amount>` to instantly place a large bet (or any amount you want).
  - title: Extend timer for your prediction
    content: If time for your prediction is running short, add some extra time with `/extend <extra time>`.
  - title: Close your prediction early
    content: If the results are out early and you want to stop receiving bets, `/stop` the prediction.
  - title: Cancel and refund your prediction
    content: |-
      If things don't work out as planned and you can't decide the winner between 🔷 or 🔶, offering everyone a `/refund` might be a good option.
      Hint: You can also flip a :coin: to decide in `/resolve`.
